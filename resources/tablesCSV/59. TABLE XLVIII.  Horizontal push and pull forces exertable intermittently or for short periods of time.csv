1/ 
May be doubled for two and tripled for three users pushing simultaneously.  For the fourth and each additional 
user, not more than 75% of their push capability shall be added. 
2/ 
See figure 100 for examples. 
3/ 
The appropriate coefficient of friction must be selected; to go from a stationary position to a moving load 
would be coefficient of static friction, but once the load is in motion, a dynamic coefficient of friction is 
needed for keeping it in motion. 
NOTE:  Values are predicated upon a surface (as illustrated on figure 100) the user may use to aid in force exertion 
(i.e., a vertical rough surface that is approximately 40 cm [16 in] wide and 50 to 125 cm [20 to 50 in] above the floor 
to allow force application with the hands, the shoulder, or the back).","",""
