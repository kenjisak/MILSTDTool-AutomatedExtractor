"Effects of Sustained +Gx Acceleration (Eyeballs-In)",""
"1.0 Gx","Slight increase in abdominal pressure; respiratory rate increases."
"+2.0 to +3.0 Gx","Difficulty in spatial orientation; +2.0 G tolerable for at least 24 hours."
"+3.0 to +6.0 Gx","Progressive tightness in chest and abdomen; cardiac rhythm disturbances; loss of peripheral 
vision; difficulty in breathing  and speaking; blurring of vision; effort required to maintain focus; 
+4.0 Gx tolerable up to at least 60 minutes."
"+6.0 to +9.0 Gx","Chest pain and pressure; shallow respiration from position of nearly full inspiration; decreased 
oxygen uptake during  acceleration; pulmonary vascular pressures increase towards the dorsal 
part of chest and fall in alveolar pressure on the  ventral part; arterial oxygen saturation falls 
below 85%, which can lead to cognitive impairment; further reductions in visual  acuity and 
depth perception, increased blurring, and occasional tunneling; great concentration required to 
maintain focus;  occasional lacrimation (tears); body, legs, and arms cannot be lifted at +8.0 G; 
head cannot be lifted at +9.0 G; precise  manual control compromised."
"+9.0 to +12 Gx","Increased severity of symptoms; severe breathing difficulty; increased chest pain; marked fatigue; 
loss of peripheral vision;  diminution of central visual acuity, lacrimation."
">+12 Gx","Extreme difficulty in breathing and speaking; severe viselike chest pain; loss of tactile sensation; 
total loss of vision possible."
"Effects of Sustained –Gx Acceleration (Eyeballs-Out)",""
"+1 Gx to -1 Gx","Equivalent to the erect or seated terrestrial posture."
"All levels","Similar to those of forward acceleration with modifications produced by reversal of the force 
vector; chest pressure  reversed.  Total body restraint system is critical and has a direct 
relationship with the ability to tolerate rearward acceleration  exposures."
"Effects of Sustained ±Gy Acceleration (Eyeballs Left/Right)",""
"-1 Gy to +1 Gy","Equivalent to the erect or seated terrestrial posture."
"±1.0 to 2.0 Gy","Difficulty maintaining head and shoulders upright without restraints; difficulty of precise manual 
control; loss of vision in ‘uphill’ eye; requirement for head and body bracing or restraints."
"±3.0 Gy","Discomfort after 10 seconds; pressure on restraint system; feeling of supporting entire weight on 
clavicle; inertial movement  of hips and legs; yawing and rotation of head toward shoulder; 
petechiae and bruising; painful engorgement of dependent elbow; increased work of breathing 
and risk of atelectasis; full body restraint system is critical."
"±5.0 Gy","Conjunctival hemorrhage has been reported; severe headache after exposure."
