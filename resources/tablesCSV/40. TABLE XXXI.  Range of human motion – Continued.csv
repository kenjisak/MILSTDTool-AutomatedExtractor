"NOTES: 
1. 
Refer to 5.8.4.3 for detailed limitations of these data. 
2. 
Flexion:  Bending or decreasing the angle between parts of the body. 
3. 
Extension:  Straightening or increasing the angle between parts of the body. 
4. 
Adduction:  Moving toward the midline of the body. 
5. 
Abduction:  Moving away from the midline of the body. 
6.  Medial rotation:  Turning toward the midplane of the body. 
7. 
Lateral rotation:  Turning away from the midplane of the body. 
8. 
Pronation:  Rotation of the palm of the hand downward. 
9. 
Supination:  Rotation of the palm of the hand upward. 
10.  Radial deviation:  Hand moving toward radius (bone). 
11.  Ulnar deviation:  Hand moving toward ulna (bone). 
12.  Plantar flexion:  Movement that increases angle between the foot and leg. 
13.  Dorsi flexion:  Movement that decreases the angle between the foot and leg. 
14.  Tibial angle (posterior and anterior) is relative to a reference line formed at a right angle to the base of 
the foot.","","",""
