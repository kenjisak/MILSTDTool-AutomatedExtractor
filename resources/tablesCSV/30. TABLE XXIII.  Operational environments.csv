"A","The environment is classified as 
strictly vibration and can be 
characterized as oscillatory in nature 
(periodic). 
Examples:  Ground vehicles on 
relatively smooth road and aircraft 
with minimal to moderate turbulence","0.5 to 80 Hz* 
X, Y, and Z 
(note:  refer to ISO 2631-1 
Figure 1, Basicentric axes of 
the human body)","Health (5.5.5.1.5) 
Comfort (5.5.5.1.6) 
Perception (5.5.5.1.7) 
Performance (5.5.5.1.8)"
"B","The environment is classified as 
predominately vibration and can be 
characterized as oscillatory in nature 
(periodic) but also contains occasional 
shocks or transient vibration 
(aperiodic). 
Examples:  Off-road ground vehicles 
with severe terrain and aircraft in 
severe buffeting","0.5 to 80 Hz* 
X, Y, and Z 
(note:  refer to ISO 2631-1 
Figure 1, Basicentric axes of 
the human body)","Health (5.5.5.1.5) 
Comfort (5.5.5.1.6) 
Perception (5.5.5.1.7) 
Performance (5.5.5.1.8)"
"C","The environment may contain some 
underlying vibration, but is dominated 
by repeated or multiple shocks or 
transient vibration exceeding  
9.81 ms-2 or 1 g. 
Examples:  Aircraft in extreme 
buffeting; vessels at 20+ knots in sea 
state 5","0.01 to 80 Hz 
Vertical (Z) Only","Health (5.5.5.1.5)"
"D","The environment is classified as low 
frequency oscillatory motion at or 
below 0.5 Hz that can cause kinetosis 
or motion sickness and other 
associated syndromes. 
Examples:  Motion in ships, undersea 
vehicles, sea rescue vehicles, and 
other sea vessels; low frequency 
oscillations during aircraft 
maneuvering; spacecraft","0.1 to 0.5 Hz 
Vertical (Z) Only","Motion Sickness (5.5.5.1.9)"
"NOTE:  Some environments may include major frequency components beyond 80 Hz that consistently occur 
during vehicle operation (i.e., some propeller aircraft).  A higher frequency range may be warranted in these 
cases.  ISO 2631-1 provides one-third octave weightings up to 400 Hz.","","",""
