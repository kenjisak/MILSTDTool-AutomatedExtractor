"Function","Color","Definition of Function"
"Intensified pressure","Purple/Violet","Pressure in excess of supply pressure induced by a booster or intensifier."
"Supply pressure","Red","Pressure of the power-actuating fluid."
"Charging pressure","Intermittent red","Pump-inlet pressure higher than atmospheric pressure."
"Reduced pressure","Intermittent red","Auxiliary pressure lower than supply pressure."
"Metered flow","Yellow","Fluid at a controlled flow rate (other than pump delivery)."
"Exhaust","Blue","Return of the power-actuating fluid to reservoir."
"Intake","Green","Sub-atmospheric pressure, usually on the intake side of the pump."
"Drain","Green","Return of leakage of control-actuating fluid to reservoir."
"Inactive","Blank","Fluid within the circuit but not serving a functional purpose during the 
phase being represented."
