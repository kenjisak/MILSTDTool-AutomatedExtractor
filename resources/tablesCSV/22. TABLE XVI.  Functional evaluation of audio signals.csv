"Quantitative 
indication","Poor, maximum of 5 to 6 
tones absolutely 
recognizable.","Poor, interpolation between 
signals inaccurate.","Good, minimum time and error in 
obtaining exact value in terms 
compatible with response."
"Qualitative 
indication","Poor-to-fair, difficult to 
judge approximate value 
and direction of deviation 
from null setting unless 
presented in close temporal 
sequence.","Poor, difficult to judge 
approximate deviation from 
desired value.","Good, information concerning 
displacement, direction, and rate 
presented in form compatible with 
required response."
"Status 
indication","Good, start and stop 
timing.  Continuous 
information where rate of 
change of input is low.","Good, especially sounded for 
irregularly occurring signals 
(e.g., alarm signals).","Poor, inefficient; more easily 
masked; problem of repeatability."
"Tracking","Fair, null position easily 
monitored; problem of 
signal-response 
compatibility.","Poor, required qualitative 
indications difficult to 
provide.","Good, meaning intrinsic in signal."
"General","Good for automatic 
communication of limited 
information.  Meaning 
must be learned.  Easily 
generated.","Some sounds available with 
common meaning (e.g., fire 
bell).  Easily generated.","Most effective for rapid (but not 
automatic) communication of 
complex, multi-dimensional 
information.  Meaning intrinsic in 
signal and context when 
standardized.  Minimum of new 
learning required."
