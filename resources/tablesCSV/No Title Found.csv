1/ 
Unless otherwise noted, the dimensions specified apply to ungloved finger touch. 
2/ 
For standard cotton flame-resistant anti-flash gloves (i.e., Navy flash gloves [as defined in 
MIL-G-2874]) use, add 5 mm (0.2 in) to each dimension of the actuation area (A). 
3/ 
For touchscreens that use a “first contact” actuation strategy, separation between targets shall be 
not less than 5 mm (0.2 in).  For touchscreens that use a “last contact” strategy, separation 
between targets may be less than 5 mm (0.2 in), but not less than 3 mm (0.12 in) for applications 
other than alphanumeric/numeric keyboards.","","",""
