"Effects of Sustained +Gz Acceleration (Eyeballs Down)",""
"+1.0 Gz","Equivalent to the erect or seated terrestrial posture."
"+2.0 to +2.5 Gz","Increased weight; increased pressure on buttocks; drooping of face and body tissues; difficulty in 
use of touchscreens or other precision hand/arm movements."
"+3.0 to +4.0 Gz","Heaviness in arms and legs intensifies and movement of the extremities becomes difficult; head 
movement difficult at or above +4Gz; dimming of vision; difficulty in viewing head-down 
displays; loss of color vision (“grayout”), tunneling, or loss of  peripheral vision."
"+5.0 to +6.0 Gz","Tachycardia or other dysrhythmia; leg swelling; muscle cramps; labored breathing; petechiae in 
lower extremities; complete loss of vision (“blackout”).  Total G-LOC typically occurs at +6.0 Gz 
or beyond.  Following unconsciousness, cognitive and psychomotor function may take 55 seconds 
to fully recover.  Anti-G-suit and Anti-G Straining Maneuver required to maintain physiological and 
cognitive performance."
">+6.0 Gz","Protection needed to preserve consciousness and health."
"Effects of Sustained -Gz Acceleration (Eyeballs Up)",""
"+1 Gz to -1 Gz","Increased blood pressure to the upper body and head; beginning stages of bradycardia; transition to 
>+1 Gz may result in decreased physiological performance at lower than normally tolerated +Gz."
"-1.0 Gz","Tolerable; sense of pressure and fullness in the head; congestion of eyes; compensatory bradycardia, 
cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilation; compromised physiological performance 
upon transition to lower than normally tolerated +Gz."
"-2.0 to -3.0 Gz","Severe facial congestion; bradycardia; dysrhythmia; throbbing headache; blurring, graying, or 
occasional reddening of vision  after 5.0 seconds; compensatory bradycardia, cerebral 
vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilation; compromised physiological performance upon 
transition to lower than normally tolerated +Gz; congestion disappears slowly; may leave petechial 
hemorrhages, swollen eyelids."
">-3.0 Gz","Red-out; mental confusion and unconsciousness."
